Meridion
========

Meridion is an online reputation system integrated into the YaBB SE web forum system.

Introduction to Meridion
------------------------

The one thing that cannot be faked in an on-line environment is a reputation. It has to be developed over time. The Church of Virus has established Meridion, a Reputation rating system, which permits any member of this system to affect the reputation of the members of the congregation. Meridion is a weighted, reputation based feedback system, intended to allow the establishment of a Sumucracy, a system wherein a self-governing community gives more weight to those people who are respected by the community.

Meridion has many purposes. One is that it is a mechanism for introducing self-directed evolutionary change. Everyone involved in the reputation system plays a role in determining how we evolve. Meridion establishes a collective, collaborative mechanism for determining the meaning of "fittest" and a methodology for evolving evolutionary strategies. We anticipate that our evolution will become faster, and more rational in consequence of Meridion. By instantiating a mechanism designed to allow us to present ourselves more effectively, we should see our growth increase dramatically. Which helps us to propagate our memeplex. Those actively involved in doing so, will hopefully see a very immediate reward, further encouraging the involvement of others in "helping our evolution." Those actively involved in Meridion have the ability to change its form and application. All members of the Virian Congregation are invited and in fact are strongly encouraged to join Meridion and become involved in this process, formally on the wiki, less formally on the BBS and informally on IRC. It should be noted that Virion Vectors who do not choose to join Meridion are also involved in its definition, as they are tacitly accepting and approving the system as it is being developed.Meridion also will assist in regulating conduct through feedback from the community, reducing the need to apply the draconian consequences of silencing or disownment which previously were our only remedies for anti-social behaviour. As part of instituting Meridion, we have established some formal and informal processes, and are in the process of establishing others, to ensure that our BBS, which is not just our church, meeting hall and neighborhood bar, but also our primary advertising of ourselves to the public, serves as a friendly local place, where Virians can meet, teach learn and discuss things.


Joining Meridion
----------------

1. Create an account on the BBS.
2. Rate other members.

As soon as your ratings are saved, others gain the ability to rate you.

How Meridion Functions
----------------------

Members of Meridion allocate one another's 'Reputations', by assigning them values in the range

1. This person should be banned
2. Little or no redeeming value
3. Strongly negative opinion
4. Slight negative opinion
5. Neutral or no opinion
6. Slight positive opinion
7. Strong positive opinion
8. A credit to the the community
9. A pillar of the community

For the purpose of evaluating 'Reputation', 'Influence' and 'Equity', members who are not yet rated by others are administratively allocated a 'neutral Reputation' of 5.

Calculations
------------

### How are reputations calculated?

An algorithm automatically calculates effective reputations using a routine which recursively redistributes the points awarded until the model stabilizes, yielding an average rating weighted by each member's influence.

### How is influence calculated?

Influence reflects how much weight a member's opinion carries. This is calculated from the reputation such that in a community of N members the voting weight is allocated as:

- Level 9 voting weight N
- Level 5 voting weight 1
- Level 1 voting weight 1/N

The exact formula to calculate an influence from a reputation R is e^(ln(N)*2*(R-5)/(9-1)).

### How is equity calculated?

Members of the Virian congregation are assigned "equity" in the Church of Virus which is based upon their reputation. The equity for each member of the Virian congregation is calculated as the percentage of the total influence wielded by this member, where the 'Influence' is a determination of how much weight a member's opinion carries. In this way, a member's 'Equity' reflects the percentage of the total influence wielded by a member.
